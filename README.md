# Overview

This is a program I wrote to familiarize myself better with the Rust programming language. I'm working to strengthen my skills as a Software Developer major at BYU-Idaho.

The software I've written here is a small game of Guess a Number. After the user enters some input to start the game, the program gives the user hints of "higher" or "lower" to help them guess the correct number. Once the user guesses the correct number, the game is over, and the user wins.

The purpose for this software is to use and display examples of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions in the Rust language. It should provide a simple example of how the language works and is displayed.

# Development Environment

This was developed using VS Code and with the help of Cargo for crate management.

I used the Rust program with a rand dependencie added for generating random numbers.

# Future Work

- I want to make a GUI for input and output
- I felt like the winner notification could be improved
- Improving the opening input display would be great too
